# Testing Guide

This guide provides an overview of the testing strategy employed by the BitComm project. It covers the types of tests, tools, and processes for ensuring application quality and reliability.

## Testing Strategy

The testing strategy for BitComm focuses on core aspects of the application:

- Unit Testing
- Integration Testing
- End-to-End (E2E) Testing
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- Performance and Security Testing

## Testing Tools

- **Vitest**: Fast unit test framework
- **Playwright**: For E2E and cross-browser testing
- **Jest**: Used for test infrastructure
- **ESLint**: Linting tool for code quality
- **Prettier**: Code formatting

## Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on individual components, functions, and services:
- Location: `/src/services/__tests__` and `/src/components/__tests__`
- Command: `npm run test`
- Framework: Vitest

## Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that components and services work together as expected:
- Location: `/tests/integration`
- Command: `npm run test:integration`
- Framework: Vitest

## End-to-End Tests

E2E tests simulate real-world user scenarios in an automated way:
- Location: `/tests/e2e`
- Command: `npm run test:e2e`
- Framework: Playwright

## User Acceptance Tests

UAT ensures the application meets user requirements and fits real-world scenarios:
- Location: `/tests/uat`
- Command: `npm run test:uat`
- Framework: Playwright

## Performance and Security Testing

Performance and security testing ensures the application performs well under load and is resilient to attacks:
- Location: `/tests/performance` and `/tests/security`
- Framework: Custom scripts, Playwright

## Test Execution

1. **Run Unit Tests**
   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

2. **Run Integration Tests**
   ```bash
   npm run test:integration
   ```

3. **Run E2E Tests**
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

4. **Run UAT Tests**
   ```bash
   npm run test:uat
   ```

5. **Check Coverage**
   ```bash
   npm run test:coverage
   ```

## Test Environment

The recommended test environment replicates the production setup:
- **Node.js**: Version 18+
- **Browsers**: Latest Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- **OS**: Windows, macOS, and Linux support

## Continuous Integration

Testing is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring every change is validated. GitHub Actions is used to automatically run tests on every push and pull request.

## Best Practices

- Write tests for all new features
- Keep tests fast; avoid unnecessary network calls
- Use mocking to isolate tests
- Regularly refactor tests to maintain quality
