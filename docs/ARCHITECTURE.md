# BitComm Architecture Overview

## Introduction
This document provides an in-depth overview of the BitComm application architecture, detailing the system's components, interconnections, and technologies used to deliver a secure decentralized messaging platform.

## System Components

### Frontend
- **React with TypeScript**: Utilized for building the user interface and managing application state.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Provides utility-first CSS framework for responsive design.
- **PWA Support**: Ensures the application works offline and resembles a native app experience.

### Backend Services
- **Supabase**: Manage authentication and real-time user data.
- **WebRTC**: Facilitates peer-to-peer communication, allowing direct connections.
- **IndexedDB**: Employed for browser local storage to cache data and enable offline operations.

### Blockchain Integration
- **Bitcoin Network**: Utilized to verify identities and ensure message authenticity via on-chain proofs.
- **Proof-of-Work Algorithms**: Introduce a computational requirement per message, mitigating spam attacks.

## Logical Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **User Interface Interaction**: Triggers events and state changes within the frontend.
2. **Peer Discovery**: Nodes discover each other via the DHT overlay network, forming a mesh.
3. **Messaging**: Encrypted messages traverse the network, with proof-of-work checks ensuring validity.
4. **Identity Verification**: Bitcoin network is queried to authenticate user-provided identity proofs.
5. **Storage Management**: Data is persisted locally via IndexedDB, keeping user privacy in mind.

## Security Considerations
- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM is used for data encryption and ECDH for key exchanges.
- **Zero-Knowledge**: Architectural choices prevent any server from accessing unencrypted user data.
- **SCR**: Security Cipher Rotation is implemented to handle session-level encryption keys, enforcing forward secrecy.

## Best Practices
- **Modular Design**: Individual components can be maintained and developed in isolation.
- **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive tests cover every module, ensuring code reliability and security.
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing and integration are set up for seamless updates and maintenance.
