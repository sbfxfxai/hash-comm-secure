# Identity Management Guide

This document provides a comprehensive guide on managing identities within the BitComm application, ensuring secure and user-friendly features for self-sovereign identity management.

## Introduction
BitComm utilizes decentralized, self-sovereign identities allowing users to fully control and manage their online presence without reliance on a central authority.

## Features
- **Decentralized Identity Creation**: Users can generate identities with cryptographic guarantees, verifiable on the Bitcoin blockchain.
- **Secure Storage**: Identities are stored locally, encrypted and accessible only to the user.
- **Cross-Platform Synchronization**: Sync identities across devices without server storage.

## Creating an Identity
Follow these steps to create your decentralized identity:
1. **Navigate to Identity Manager**: Access the Identity Manager tab via the main navigation.
2. **Fill in Details**: Enter an identity name.
3. **Generate Identity**: Click the "Create Identity" button to generate your BitComm identity.
4. **Verify Creation**: Confirm the identity is registered and visible in the Identity Manager.

## Managing Identities
### Activate Identity
1. **Select an Identity**: In the Identity Manager, click on an identity to activate it.
2. **Confirm Activation**: Active identity will be highlighted and used for all outgoing communications.

### Delete Identity
1. **Identify Target Identity**: Locate the identity to delete in the Identity Manager.
2. **Initiate Deletion**: Click the "Delete" button next to the target identity.
3. **Confirm Action**: Deletion is permanent; ensure the correct identity is selected.

## Security Considerations
- **Private Management**: All operations occur client-side. Only encrypted identities are stored locally.
- **User Control**: Users have the autonomy to create, modify, or delete identities without platform intervention.
- **Proof of Existence**: Identities can be validated against blockchain records for authenticity.

## Troubleshooting
- **Identity Not Found**: Ensure local storage is enabled and no browser extensions block access.
- **Tampering Detected**: If identity inconsistencies are detected, consider re-creating your identity.
